1. Project Overview

Welcome to the Smart Study Assistant (SSA)! This project is an ambitious, end-to-end AI engineering journey to create an intelligent learning companion. The SSA aims to revolutionize how students interact with their study materials by providing organization, intelligent search, personalized explanations, and generative Q&A capabilities.

This README will evolve alongside the project, reflecting its growing complexity and features.

2. Vision & Goals

The core vision for the SSA is to build an AI that acts as:

Your Digital Librarian: Smartly ingesting, organizing, and categorizing all your study materials.

Your Intelligent Search Engine: Moving beyond keywords to understand the meaning of your queries and documents.

Your Personalized Tutor: Offering contextual Q&A, explanations tailored to your needs, and potentially adaptive learning paths.

Your AI Study Buddy: An autonomous agent capable of orchestrating various AI tools to assist your learning journey.

Each phase of this project integrates new AI/engineering concepts directly into the SSA, making it progressively smarter and more functional.

3. Features

Phase 1: Data Management & Foundation

Document Ingestion (CLI): Add text documents from local files.

Structured Document Storage: Documents are represented as objects with title, content, path, date.

Basic Analytics: (e.g., Count of documents, word count).

Phase 2: Machine Learning Fundamentals

Document Type Classification: Automatically tag documents (e.g., Lecture, Article).

Content Clustering: Group semantically similar documents.

Phase 3: Deep Learning Capabilities

Semantic Embeddings: Documents are represented by meaningful vectors.

Extractive Summarization: Generate short summaries of document sections.

Phase 4: LLMs & AI Agents

Generative Q&A: Answer questions using LLMs based on document context.

Contextual Explanations: Provide tailored explanations.

Agent Orchestration: An AI agent selects the best tool for your request.

Phase 5: MLOps & Deployment

RESTful API: All SSA functionalities accessible via a FastAPI endpoint.

Dockerization: Project containerized for consistent deployment.

CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing and deployment.

4. Technologies Used

Core Language: Python 3.9+

Data Handling: NumPy, Pandas

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

Deep Learning: TensorFlow / Keras

Natural Language Processing: Hugging Face transformers, sentence-transformers

LLM Orchestration: LangChain / LangGraph
