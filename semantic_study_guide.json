      "summary": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning uses rewards and penalties to guide learning.",
